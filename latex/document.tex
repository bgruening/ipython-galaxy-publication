\section{Summary:}
The Galaxy Tool Shed enables easy installation, dependency management, and updates of tools in the Galaxy ecosystem. However, if tools are not available in the Galaxy Tool Shed, a Galaxy administrator often can not help a user directly, forcing the user has to resort to download their data and leave the Galaxy environment for further analysis. The integration of IPython in Galaxy allows for analysis of data within the Galaxy framework with the full versatility of Python and its scientific libraries. This bridges the gap between users with programming experience and Galaxy by adding the flexibility of quickly prototyping solutions problems and doing data analysis, while staying within the context of the Galaxy framework and retaining the large toolset already available. IPython is executed in a Docker container which is invoked and terminated automatically. This design provides a secure framework for the user and the Galaxy system.


\section{Availability and implementation:}
The integration of IPython in Galaxy was accomplished via the Galaxy Visualization Framework. Notebook level security is provided by IPython isolation within a docker container. This Galaxy plugin is freely available under the MIT License and can be downloaded from https://github.com/bgruening/galaxy-ipython. The Docker image is hosted on Docker Hub under bgruening/docker-ipython-notebook and is used automatically by the plugin.

\section{Introduction}


The Galaxy platform \citep{Blank2010,Giardine2005,Goecks2010} has made advanced bioinformatics software accessible to life scientists for many years. Galaxy has a default set of analysis tools and can be extended with additional tools by locally produced tools, or by using the community driven collections of tools available from the Galaxy Tool Shed \citep{Blankenber2014}. This approach to extend Galaxy and adding new data analysis tools to a Galaxy instance is sufficient in most cases, a more flexible tool allowing for a more tailored analysis may be needed. In this work the IPython Galaxy project is introduced where the Galaxy framework is extended with a an interface to an IPython \citep{Perez2007} instance running inside a Docker container. IPython provides a web service which provides a graphical and interactive way to compute and visualize data, extensible through publicly available Python libraries. The IPython instance is run within a Docker container, which isolates the tool from the rest of the system and provides security for both the user and the Galaxy instance. Finally, by providing and encouraging a route for arbitrary data analysis to be accomplished within the Galaxy framework, IPython notebooks allow for for saved and embeded logs of analysis, furthering the ultimate goal of research reproducibility.



\begin{methods}
\section{Methods}

IPython is integrated into Galaxy through a visualization plugin. The program flow is sketched in a diagram in fig.~\ref{fig:diagram}. A Galaxy visualization plugin primarily consists of a python Mako template file, and some associated configuration data. The IPython visualization plugin configuration allows for some additional security configuration of interest to production instances. The plugin can be forced to send data using SSL and to use password authentication. Additionally, the name of a custom docker image can be provided. This image will be downloaded and installed from the Docker Hub. The default Docker image is specially crafted to use in conjunction with the Galaxy plugin and will be described in more detail later. The configuration is also responsible for providing a history data set association (HDA) for the template file so that it has access to the data. \\
The template file of the visualization is written in Mako, a Python template engine which can be used in conjunction with HTML and Javascript code to generate web pages. In the first part of this plugin's template file a key file with a password and an API-key for the Docker container is generated. In this key file several things are stored so that Galaxy and the IPython web service, which will be started in the Docker container, can communicate isolated from the rest of the server. Most importantly a unique port is attributed to each Docker container so that different users using this plugin on the same server do not interfere with each other. \\
% TODO: Not a fan of previous paragraph
Once configuration files and other preperatory work is complete, the Docker container is launched with bi-directional access to a temporary directory containing the necessary initialization information. The default Docker container is custom built and works hand-in-hand with the plugin. The container is built on top of a basic Debian Wheezy installation, and provides a basic IPython server, with its dependencies and some extra Python libraries such as numpy, scipy and matplotlib. By providing images with a full suite of Python scientific analsis tools and libraries, users are able to quickly perform their intricate analysis and calculations immediately. Other Python packages can be installed with the pip tool and in principle anything can be installed in this container. The IPython notebook is then embedded inside the usual Galaxy interface and can be used to interactively program in Python. Having abstracted the chosen container into a site-specific configuration option, Galaxy instances with different use cases and needs can provide Docker images to their users with appropriate tool suites.\\
During Docker container startup, a cron job is launched which allows for determining whether or not the IPython service is still being used by checking the network traffic. If the page with the Ipython notebook is closed, after a minute the Docker process automatically terminates itself. Furthermore two important custom functions are defined which enable the user load data from the history or store data to the Galaxy history respectively using the Galaxy API \citep{Sloggett2013}. The \textbf{\texttt{get}} function expects one parameter with the identifier of the data set which corresponds to the number of the data set in the history. The \textbf{\texttt{put}} function automatically builds a connection to the host Galaxy instance with the correct history ID and uploads a specified file inside the Docker container to the user's history from which the IPython service was started. The flexibility of this plugin is obvious: any data set can be loaded into the notebook, data sets can be combined or modified, and the results can be written back to the history all without the need for the user to download and upload data. \\
% Lack of segue between "itself. Furthermore"
Upon starting the IPython visualization a check is performed on the data set from which the IPython visualization was called; compatible IPython notebooks will be reused, while other datasets utilize a notebook generated from a template. It should be stressed that this functionality ensures the reproducibility of data analysis performed with this plugin, and is therefore an essential feature.


\section{Use Case}

Prior to the existence of the Galaxy IPython plugin, if a user wanted to transform and plot a specific column of a dataset and get the result in a file of the Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) format so they can do further image manipulation, the user would have to download the data set which could take a long time depending on the file size and their internet connection, complete their plotting of the dataset and record their commands to make it reproducible. The task of plotting seems trivial at first because there are several useful tools in the toolshed for data visualization, however these fail to provide a user and research friendly workflow. With the use of the IPython visualization tool the user could copy their data set inside the docker container with the \texttt{get()} command. They can then manipulate the data remotely with a fully functional Python shell, generate their plots, and finally store datasets and their notebook. This workflow reduces the input time and effort required on the end user significantly, the process of generating the plot and exporting it as an SVG file becomes a matter of a few lines of python and a couple mouse clicks.

\lstset{language=python,
morekeywords={put, get}
}
\begin{lstlisting}[frame=single]
from matplotlib import pyplot as p
filename = get(57)
p.plotfile(filename,delimiter='\t',cols=(0,12))
p.savefig("col12.svg")
put("col12.svg")
\end{lstlisting}
In the code example the data set which has the ID 57 in the Galaxy history is loaded into the IPython notebook inside the plotfile method of an matplolib.pyplot object. Of this file the 13the column is plotted against the first column and the resulting plot is stored as a SVG file. The put command copies the image into the Galaxy history, so it is now persistently stored and can be downloaded or shared like any other Galaxy object.

\caption{Diagram of the program flow when the IPython Visualization is used. The IPython visualization plugin is divided into two parts; the first part generates initialization information and an IPython notebook, in the second part it launches a container from a specific Docker image. In this Docker container, IPython and all its dependencies are installed as well as some Python libraries. The configuration file and the IPython notebook are copied to the container and the IPython Webservice is started. The second part of the visualization template now generates a connection to the web service provided by the Docker container. For self cleaning, the container also checks whether or not a connection to it exists, allowing the container to terminate itself if it no longer in use.}

\section{Conclusion}
The IPython-Docker container adds versatility to Galaxy by embedding a Python shell in a secure and easy to install manner. This plugin represents a major shortcut for anybody with some programming experience who can not wait for a specific tool to be implemented in Galaxy or who needs more control to manipulate data. The possibilities with this plugin are immense and the small example is just a glimpse of what could be done with a fully implemented scipy stack. The major security concern of giving a user access to such a powerful tool such as IPython has been taken care of by putting the IPython web service inside a Docker container. This puts the user in a sandbox and isolates him from the rest of the system such that he can not break the system or read sensitive data from other users. The user can interact with the Galaxy instance with the two predefined functions \textit{put} and \textit{get} and these two functions essentially define the exchange between the container and the Galaxy instance. With the possibility to store the IPython notebook in the history, consistent and reproducible data analysis is possible and encouraged. By publishing or sharing a history containing IPython notebooks, notebooks can be easily shared with other users. That way users with no programming experience can benefit from notebooks developed by users with programming experience.
